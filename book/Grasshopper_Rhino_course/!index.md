## Introduction

Welcome to this course about Computational design using Rhino and Grasshopper. This program is geared towards product design for personalized fit products and design for digital fabrication.

The lessons are built up with the following components:

üìå ********************Outlines:******************** A short description of what you can expect in the upcoming section.
üìë **Explanation text:** Written explanations with supporting images.
üë©‚Äçüè´ ************************************Explanation videos:************************************ Explaining the course material in short lecture videos.
üì∫ **Tutorial videos:** Follow-along tutorials.
üí° T********************ips:******************** Tips and tricks to make working in Rhino/Grasshopper easier.
üñ±Ô∏è **Exercises:** Small practice questions. The solution is provided.
üíª **Assignments:** Open-ended assignments, to practice further with the course materials.

**Use instructions**
***As part of a course*:** If you use this course material as part of a Delft University of Technology course, the course might require that the homework assignments are handed in. Details on the procedure and location for submission will be provided in the course. Please consult the course coordinator or learning environment (e.g. Brightspace), for more information on Grasshopper support and assignment feedback. 
***Self-paced, autonomous learning***: The course materials are designed with the intent that you can also follow them by yourself. However, no formal support is provided with this course material. For question regarding your personal design, please consult Grasshopper knowledge bases, forums, or a Grasshopper expert. If you have comments or questions about these course materials, feel free to contact us. Note, that we might not have the capacity to help you out with your personal design questions.

**Background info**
These lessons were developed as part of the Industrial Design Engineering curriculum, at the TU Delft, for the following courses**:**

- Prototyping with/for digital fabrication (IO3850), part of the Minor Advanced Prototyping
- Computational Design for Digital Fabrication, elective of Industrial Design Engineering, TU Delft

These lessons were created using Rhino 7, Grasshopper build 1.0.0007*.*
