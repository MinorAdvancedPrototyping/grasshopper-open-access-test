As a design student, you know that creating successful products is not just about aesthetics, but also functionality and user experience. To achieve this, designers need to understand how users interact with their products and incorporate this knowledge into the design process. This is where data-driven design comes in. By collecting and analyzing data, designers can create products that are tailored to the needs and preferences of their users. In [Design for Personalized Fit](../Design%20for%20Personalized%20Fit/%21index.md), we explored how we can create the basis for our product geometry from the userâ€™s 3D scanned data to ensure a personalized fit. In this lesson, we will explore how we can expand on personalized products by adding additional functionality and ergonomic comfort to our 

In this tutorial, we'll explore how Rhino Grasshopper, a powerful computational design tool, can be used for data-driven design in ergonomics. Specifically, we'll look at how Rhino Grasshopper can help designers collect and analyze ergonomic data, and use this data to create parametric designs that respond to user needs. We'll provide examples of how designers can leverage Rhino Grasshopper to create better products that are not only visually stunning but also functional, safe, and comfortable for users. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use Rhino Grasshopper for data-driven design and be equipped with practical skills that you can apply to your design projects.
